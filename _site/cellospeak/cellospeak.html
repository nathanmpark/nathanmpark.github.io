    <section class="content-text">
      <p>Cellospeak was created in 2000 by the Founder and Artistic Director Dorothy Amarandos as a summer workshop for adult cello students yearning for an opportunity to play in ensembles.  In 2007, Cellospeak was formally organized as a company and was granted tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Since then, Cellospeak has grown not only in size but also in the scope and range of its activities.  We are increasingly focused on creating educational materials, music resources and social networks of interest to adult cellists everywhere, regardless of their ability to participate in the Workshop.  In 2010 we launched a membership initiative to provide greater sustained benefits to Cellospeak enthusiasts.</p>

    <section class="content-text">
      <p>It is our mission to provide opportunities for inspiring and enriching cello instruction for adults from all professions, backgrounds, and stages of life to come together in the Cellospeak Programs to share a love of music and the cello. There are opportunities for all those who desire to improve their playing by immersing themselves in the study of this noble instrument with like-minded individuals and accomplished cellists and to experience renewed interests, friendships, and a sense of social engagement and accomplishment.</p>
      <p>It is a well-known fact that adults of all ages who are actively engaged in one of the intensive creative arts are happier, healthier, and significantly more able to delay the negative effects of aging. While that is true, the cello is perhaps the most ideal instrument to study - whether as a first-time activity or as a renewed interest from younger days - because of its magnificent sound and range of tone and expression, and because of its suitability to play in orchestras and all forms of chamber groups. To provide opportunities to play with others, learn from the experts, and expand musical and personal horizons is what Cellospeak is all about.</p>

        <h2>Dorothy P. Amarandos</h2>
        <h2>Cellospeak Founder and Artistic Director</h2>

      <p>Dorothy Amarandos, Founder and Artistic Director of Cellospeak, has crafted a singular lifetime career as a cello teacher, performer and entrepreneur, touching the lives of hundreds of devoted students of all ages and innovating music programs of unique power and reach.</p>
      <p>For the past 25 years, she has maintained a private teaching studio in Reston for both school aged and adult cello students.  Dorothy’s teaching approach combines elements of Suzuki with more traditional instruction techniques.  Cellospeak was founded in response to requests from her adult students for opportunities to play ensembles in a supportive atmosphere.  The flagship program of Cellospeak, the two, one-week summer Cello Workshops for Adults, has grown from an initial group of 13 in 2001 to 120 participants in 2013 from as far away as Florida, Texas and Alaska.</p>
      <p>Dorothy previously performed as a member of the Fairfax Symphony Orchestra and with many free-lance professional groups in the Washington, D.C. area.  She has been a People to People Ambassador of the arts to China and the Caribbean, executive director of ASTA (American String Teachers Assoc.), and a participant in international music tours and festivals in Austria, France, England, and Spain.</p>
      <p>Prior to moving to the Washington, DC area in 1975, she was the Executive Director of the National Guild of Community Music Schools in New York City; Performing Arts Coordinator of the Michigan Council for the Arts in Detroit Michigan; professor of cello at Ohio State University as well as Denison University, Ohio Wesleyan University, and Otterbein College, and principal cellist of the Columbus Symphony in Columbus, Ohio.  While still in Rochester, she was, for 15 years, a member of the Rochester Philharmonic under Erich Leinsdorf and lecturer at the University of Rochester.</p>
      <p>During the 1960s in Rochester, New York, she was Founder/ Director/Producer of Ars Antiqua, a ground-breaking national concert touring group of actors, dancers, singers, and players of original instruments performing musical dramas of the Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque periods.  Dorothy created and directed 22 original concert-productions in which she also performed both solo and ensemble works on the viola da gamba.  The company, the only one of its kind at the time, was known for its elegance and grace, its superbly imaginative performances, its dedication to authenticity, and its devotion to bringing to life the masterpieces of ages long ago to audiences that had not heard any of it before.  In 2005, several recordings of Ars Antiqua performances originally captured on magnetic tape were rescued, digitized and compiled into a 4-CD set with a beautiful and informative booklet.  The set is available for purchase Here.</p>
      <p>Dorothy’s cello debut came at the age of 14 as a soloist with the Illinois Symphony of Chicago.  She later earned the Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees and Performer’s Certificate in cello from the Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester.  At Eastman, she studied with Luigi Silva, an internationally renowned cello performer and pedagogue, and authority on Boccherini.  In 2004, Dorothy restored and produced a special CD of a 1943 Boccherini recital (all Silva editions) performed by Silva and his students, including Dorothy herself, who was 18 at the time.</p>
