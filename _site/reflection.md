>What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned more about how padding, borders, and margin interact in relation to one another in terms of layout. Something interesting that I found was that when trying to round my profile picture out, adding padding will prevent this from happening. When moving it around, I found margin + rounded corners is possible. I think it may be due to the fact that padding adds to the original dimensions of the content.

>What did you learn about CSS positioning?

CSS positioning is quite interesting and fun to learn from trial and error. I had the most fun adding in the sidebar and trying to figure out the correct alignment of blog posts.

>What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

Once you implement the initial frame for the sidebar or other aspects of the formating, it is easy to reutilize the code as such. The most difficult is probably establishing positioning and making sure code is consistent throughout the site. Also testing the click-through process to see how the positioning and logic of the website holds up.

>What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

CSS is quite fun, and it is awesome to have immediate feedback through the Chrome Dev Tools. I also learned, that it is quite hard to make a website look "modern".
