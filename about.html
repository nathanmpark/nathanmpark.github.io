      <h2 class="first-title">Hi</h2>
        <p>My name is Nathan Park</p>
        <p>I am from Washington, DC and I studied Systems & Information Engineering at The University of Virginia. I grew up a very curious kid, always asking questions and working hard to find answers to them. I have a ton of energy and I need activities to keep me busy.</p>
        <p>I love anything outdoors. Snowboarding, longboarding, rock climbing, hiking, camping, and road tripping. I think I am a slight adrenaline junkie, but I try and subdue it to things that are not as life-threatening. Things to still try: skydiving, backcountry snowmobiling, riding a motorcycle, scuba diving, and free solo climbing.</p>
        <p>I went to Langley High School in Virginia, and graduated with my mind set on becoming a doctor. During this time I was a very committed cellist, practicing an average of 4 hours a day during competition season. I've played solos at Carnegie Hall, the Kennedy Center, and competed all throughout Virginia and Washington, DC. My commitment to music continues as I sit on the Board of Directors of Cellospeak, Inc. a non-profit organization.</p>
        <p>My time spent at The University of Virginia was filled with introspection and during this time I switched from a Chemistry major to Systems Engineering. I became enamored with data science, data mining, and statistical and predictive modeling. The most fun I had was in using languages such as R to create statistical models and project outcomes using data. I completed my B.S. with my thesis on database management for the local judiciary system. This led me to my first job at a company I love: Ventera Corporation. They gave me a chance to grow and I learned a lot while working there.</p>
        <p>I love meeting new people. There's nothing more refreshing than getting to know people, and along the way you can find some great friends. The perspective I have is that the more I put myself out there, the better chance I have of connecting with people like myself. But more importantly, its the people who are differnt that allow me to grow and expand my understanding of the world.</p>
