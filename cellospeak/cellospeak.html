      <p>Cellospeak was created in 2000 by the Founder and Artistic Director Dorothy Amarandos as a summer workshop for adult cello students yearning for an opportunity to play in ensembles.  In 2007, Cellospeak was formally organized as a company and was granted tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.  Since then, Cellospeak has grown not only in size but also in the scope and range of its activities.  We are increasingly focused on creating educational materials, music resources and social networks of interest to adult cellists everywhere, regardless of their ability to participate in the Workshop.  In 2010 we launched a membership initiative to provide greater sustained benefits to Cellospeak enthusiasts.</p>
