  <h1>Why I Chose DBC</h1>
  <h2>My DBC Experience, and How They Approach Learning Differently</h2>
  <h4>August 24, 2015</h4>

      Dev Bootcamp stuck out to me in the fact that they advertise and focus on how they are more in the business of learning as opposed to just coding. This is what attracted me the most. I am a firm believer of continious learning, and part of the reason I left my job and my home was to boost and throw myself into a growth environment.

        DBC has done an awesome job of easing me into learning. Coding isn't something easy to get across, but the succinctness of the curriculum, the way the canvas has been laid out has made things instructional, easy to follow, and also immersive in the multitude of mediums you can absorb the information and the additional resources that are available.

        I embrace this culture of learning. I embrace growth. I think people can change, and people who change can change the world. I love meeting new people, and I love to listen. People always have new things to offer, and coming from different places I am always excited to hear peoples stories.

        I would be lying if I didn't say I was nervous. I didn't know what to expect, and I was taking a chance. However, my expectations of DBC have changed in the first week of being a part of phase-0. There is something about the embrace and welcoming feel that all the faculty and other students have been promoting. There is an energy that I have not felt in a while, and is not always found in the traditional class room. Lastly, there is an uncanny embrace of fear and I love this. Be afraid, be unsure, and dive into the unknown. It is being able to do something even though you are afraid that defines you.
