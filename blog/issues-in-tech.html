    <h4>Programming for the Government</h4>
    <h4>September 13, 2015</h4>

    <div>
      <p>There is a conspcious difference between the technology stacks being utilized by the private and public sector. As a database developer, I spent the last 2 years programming for various government agencies and getting a sense of how technology is used by the government. Technology is often times the solution, but when it comes to the government it can sometimes be the biggest hinderence.</p>
      <p>A major part of government projects is the budget. This controls the extent of work, what kind of tools the team might have available, and what level of innovation can take place in revitalizing a legacy system. However, due to a majority of public projects being tax-payer funded, you can find yourself against the wall in terms of technical options. You might be stuck coding in last year's (or sometimes last decade's) technology stack. The smallest changes might have cascading impacts due to existing code, and having to adhere to strict contract agreements limit what you can touch.</p>
      <p>The complex business logic of large government entities can make using open-source a nightmare. The latest trend has been to moving to no-sql  databases (e.g. MongoDB, etc.). However, the level of policy driven data storage tends to requiring a relational database. In essence, anytime you try and implement clean design, you are met with an excess of information that is required to be presented or stored. Increasingly compplicated policy can make writing business logic into the system inefficient and repetitive.</p>
      <p>The government is limited by security. There are a number of technology alternatives that could be used to replace what is currently being used in the government. However, the largest impediment to agency use is that newer technologies have not been properly vetted and tested in a way that is deemed secure for national information.</p>
      <p>There is a long road ahead of us for trying to effectively mesh technology and government, but there are beginning to be signs of change. Recently, <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/" target="_blank">18F</a> has been a driving force of trying to implement future design and thinking into the slow moving public sector. By practicing <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/" target="_blank">lean startup</a> methodology in the federal space, there has been positive feedback in the way people are starting to embrace more technology within the government.</p>
