    <h4>How to Navigate Version Control through Terminal</h4>
    <h4>August 24, 2015</h4>

    <div>
      <p>Version Control is an important part of software development. Anytime a group of programmers may be working on a code base, it is subject to being changed by multiple individuals. <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control" target="_blank"><span>Version control</span></a> acts as a way of tracking historical changes to an original copy of code, and allows you to go back to any previous versions. Git is a type of open source version control, and Github is a website that acts as a tool to using git.</p>
      <p>Git is the version control system, while Github is the web page interface through which you can access, publish, and collaborate your git repository. Version Control is the series of commits or snapshots of work that you wish to save. This can apply to code, documents, excel sheets, etc. Any time a group of people are working on a given deliverable, version control acts as a way of preventing over-writing and maintaining a history of writes onto that given piece of work. Github helps in that it is a streamlined service for Git and was specifically designed for it. Github also allows for collaboration through the web without having to host a server or setting up your own infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Developers use Git as often times a team of developers may be working on a given module or functionality. As they code on the same piece of a project, it is important to note who worked on what code and to know what code was changed. Also, developers often peer review each other’s code, so using git is useful in reviewing code before receiving a pull request.</p>
      <p>A commit is effectively any kind of submitted work in the repository. These commits act as save points through your work history. It is said to commit often, and after a single functionality is done. In this way you will have an incremental history of each component worked on in code.</p>

        <h4>Putting things to practice...</h4>

        <p class="list-title">Create a new repository:</p>
          <ul class="page-list">
            <li>Navigate to <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank"><span>Github.com<span></a></li>
            <li>Press the “+” sign at the top right corner</li>
            <li>Name Repo</li>
            <li>Choose sharing settings</li>
            <li>Add read me file</li>
            <li>Add license if desired</li>
            <li>Create Repo!</li>
          </ul>

        <p class="list-title">Fork a repository:</p>
          <ul class="page-list">
            <li>Navigate to desired Github page</li>
            <li>Click “Fork” button at top right corner</li>
            <li>Choose which user you would like to fork to (usually yourself)</li>
            <li>Fork Repo!</li>
          </ul>

        <p class="list-title">Clone a repository through command line:</p>
          <ul class="page-list">
            <li>Navigate to desired Github page</li>
            <li>Bottom right corner copy Github link</li>
            <li>Create directory that you wish to clone to in command line</li>
            <li>Write “Git clone [Github Link]” into command line</li>
          </ul>

        <p>Forking a repository is useful in being able to retrieve a carbon copy of existing code and storing it under your own account. In this way you can work from an existing base code without having to re-write everything. You can then clone your own fork into your local directory. In the future, your new code could then be pushed back up to whatever original code base through a pull request.</p>
