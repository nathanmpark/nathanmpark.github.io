How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was a great experience working with Rosslyn, I had the pleasure of having a pair that was very up to date on semantic elements and had already done her personal challenge of creating the html for her wireframe. We had decided to work off our own wireframes and create our own HTML. Although we did not work together on a wireframe, having someone to talk through the process was very rewarding and beneficial.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Although I don't see myself as an artistic person, wireframing with a  drag and drop tool has been a life-saver. Normally I would not be able to draw to save my life, but I have been using Mockingbird to help with creating a clean and clear wireframe in the manner of minutes. I like to see what I have to build before hand, so it has proven helpful in that sense.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

Wireframing is largely a subjective practice as it depends on the audience you are catering to, but there are some good practices to keep in mind: having a separate wireframe for each page, being detailed for each design (color, size, font, buttons, etc), and keeping the design simple and clear for intuitive use.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?

Rosslyn was an awesome help in learning new semantic tags. To name a few: <aside>, <nav>, <section>, <form>, and <footer>.
