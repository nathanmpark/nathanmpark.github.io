    <h2>Entry #2</h2>
      <p>Blog Entry #2, it was a cold and windy night. The supply train had not been through in over a fortnight. Morale is low and tempers are rising. I wonder how much longer this campaign can be sustainable. Are we but men fighting for a far removed cause, or defending our land?</p>

      <p>Text here, write something interesting that someone would want to read about. I'd imagine it would have something to do with a profound experience you've had in your life.</p>
